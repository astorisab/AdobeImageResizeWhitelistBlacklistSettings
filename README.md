# Adobe Image Resize Whitelist and Blacklist

If anyone is interested in a whitelist or a blacklist for firewall settings when using Adobe Image Resize Online feel free to use this as a starting point.

The following link was used to access image resize: https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize
