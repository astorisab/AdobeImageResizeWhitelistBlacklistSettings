# Adobe Image Resize Whitelist and Blacklist

If anyone is interested in a whitelist or a blacklist for firewall settings when using Adobe Image Resize Online feel free to use this as a starting point.

These are the connections that I currently have open on my computer and the ones that I have blocked.

The following link was used to access image resize: https://www.adobe.com/express/feature/image/resize




If looking for some blocklists related to blocking app functionality, this repo created by another github contributor may be of interest:
